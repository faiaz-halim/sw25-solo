Born to a clan of wardens in the Elvenwood, he was trained from youth in the ways of the ranger\u2014tracking beasts through mist-shrouded glades, reading the stars as easily as elven script, and loosing arrows with the precision of a hunting hawk.

When he was but a stripling of 120 years (barely an adult by elven standards), he abandoned his post after a heated quarrel with his mentor, Maeren, over what Thandor saw as the clan\u2019s rigid isolationism. He wandered southward into the human kingdoms, where he joined a mercenary company to \u201csee the world,\u201d only to find himself complicit in a raid that left a frontier village burned and its people slain. The memory of a child\u2019s scream, echoing through smoke-filled streets, haunts him still. Gu",
